I strongly believes Thinking is a challenging task and very few are seen engaged in it, a good thought process, and a better understanding is the key to the overall development of an individual. In today's age of globalization and technological volatility, skill building is an important instrument to increase the efficacy and quality of labor for improved productivity and economic growth.
